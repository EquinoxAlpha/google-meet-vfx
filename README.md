# google-meet-camera-freeze

<b>Google Meet Camera Disabler</b>

This Firefox (untested on Chrome) extension adds an overlay window to every Google Meet(ing) that allows you to enable various visual effects.

Visual effects currently supported:
Freeze camera
Invert colors
Text overlay

Everything may appear inverted horizontally, but other people will see it normally.

On Linux, clone this repository, cd into it and then run

zip -r -FS ../googlemeet.zip * --exclude '*.git*'

to pack the files into an extension. Then add it as any other unsigned addon.
